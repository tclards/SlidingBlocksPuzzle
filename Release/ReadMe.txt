		Game Rules
=======================================
Move around the levels and push blocks onto the Win Circle Tiles. Once all Win Circles in a level have been covered, move onto the next one. Your player counts as a block!
Can you beat all 50 levels? 

Levels 1 through 15 are Easy.
Levels 16 through 35 are Medium.
Levels 36 through 50 are Hard.
The Level Section of the UI denotes the difficulty in Green, Yellow, or Red for Easy, Medium, and Hard.

The number of moves you make to beat each level and the time it takes you is recorded. Can you get the best time and move count for each one?

Thank for playing and have fun!
